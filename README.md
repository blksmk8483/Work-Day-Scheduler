# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.


## Description
- In this challenge I created a calendar application that allows the user to both add and save 
an event for each hour of the day.

The future of this project:
- I plan to add the colors for the hours (past, present, future).
- As well as a delete button to cancel out as needed.
